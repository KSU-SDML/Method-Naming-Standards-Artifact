What kind of badge(s) the authors are applying for as well as the reasons why the authors believe that the artifact deserves that badge(s).We are applying for (Available) and (Reusable) badges. The reason why is we are providing the method naming standards survey questions we used in Qualtrics for surveying professional developers so anybody can take a look at our Likert scale questions and source code examples used in the survey and replicated it with any other type of identifier e.g. class names, variable names with some alterations. Also, the method naming standards survey results are provided in reusable ready format (CSV) in which individuals can look at these data and create scientific hypothesis and make insightful interpretations.
